Description: Proteomatic - the Proteomics researcher's swiss army knife
 Proteomatic is a free proteomics data processing pipeline. Functionality is provided via scripts, and these scripts can be chained together into a high-throughput data processing pipeline.
 .
 All functionality can be used either from the command-line or via a GUI (graphical user interface).
 .
 Proteomatic automatically downloads necessary software packages such as OMSSA or BLAST when they are required, so it’s easy to get up and running.
