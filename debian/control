Description: Proteomatic - the Proteomics researcher's swiss army knife
 Proteomatic is an open data processing pipeline oringinally created for the purpose of evaluating Proteomics experiments. Functionality is provided via scripts, and these scripts can be chained together into a high-throughput data processing pipeline.
 .
 All functionality can be used either from the command-line or via a GUI (graphical user interface).
 .
 Proteomatic automatically downloads necessary software packages such as OMSSA or BLAST when they are required, so itâ€™s easy to get up and running.
