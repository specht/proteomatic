h1. Synopsis

Proteomatic provides a free and accessible proteomics data processing pipeline. Bits of functionality can be chained together, and functionality is provided through self-descriptive scripts.


h1. Building Proteomatic

h2. Prerequisites

Proteomatic requires "Qt":http://qt.digia.com/, "libyaml-cpp":http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/, "QuaZIP":http://quazip.sourceforge.net/ and "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/. It also requires "libmd5-rfc":http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc/ but a copy of this library's source code is already included in the source code of Proteomatic.

h2. Building procedure

<pre>
$ git submodule update --init
$ qmake "PROTEOMATIC_PORTABLE=1"
$ make release
</pre>

This gives you a version which will run from within the source directory, downloads all scripts and required software packages into its own directory and does not change anything else in the file tree.
