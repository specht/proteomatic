h1. Synopsis

Proteomatic provides a free and accessible proteomics data processing pipeline.
Bits of functionality can be chained together, and functionality is provided
through self-descriptive scripts.


h1. Building Proteomatic

h2. Prerequisites

Proteomatic requires Qt, "http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/":libyaml-cpp, and "http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc/":libmd5-rfc.

h2. Building procedure

<pre>
$ git submodule update --init
$ qmake "PROTEOMATIC_PORTABLE=1"
$ make release
</pre>

This gives you a version which will run from within the source directory, 
downloads all scripts and required software packages into its own directory
and does not change anything else in the file tree.
