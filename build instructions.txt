libyaml:

win32 (yaml-0.1.2): 

- include/yaml.h: disable declspec decoration: #define YAML_DECLARE(type)  type

- MSYS: 
	- ./configure
	- mingw32-make (test should work now)
	- copy include/yaml.h and src/.libs/libyaml.a and src/.libs/libyaml.la to MinGW include and lib dirs

bzip2/zlib:

win32

- MSYS:
	- mingw32-make
	- copy bzip2.h and libbz2.a
	
QuaZip:
- in quazip.pro, change CONFIG to CONFIG += qt warn_on staticlib (add staticlib)
