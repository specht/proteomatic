Signal cascade:
---------------

Whenever a box is changed, changes might be far-reaching. To cope with this
the design is as follows:

Whenever a box changes, it decides whether to invalidate itself via invalidate()
or not. In addition, it may call invalidateNext(int), which invalidates all 
following boxes up the specified distance. 

Input group proxy boxes reimplement invalidate() and invalidateNext(int) to
invalidate one box further.

Invalidate is directly called via a direct signal/slot connection, marking the
box as requiring an update.

When the fuzz in the event queue is over, globalUpate is called, which updates
the boxes in topological order, and resets all boxes to a clean state.
