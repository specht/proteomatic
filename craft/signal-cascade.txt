Signal cascade:
---------------

Whenever a box is changed, changes might be far-reaching. To cope with this
the design is as follows:

1. Whenever a box has changed, its invalidate() slot is called, which 
triggers SIGNAL(requestGlobalUpdate()), which is called via a queued 
signal/slot connection so that the actual update is not carried out until
the big fuss is over and everything's calm again, or at leats hopefully so >:)
