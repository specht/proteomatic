PROTEOMATIC
===========

Proteomatic provides a free and accessible proteomics data processing pipeline.
Bits of functionality can be chained together, and functionality is provided
through self-descriptive scripts.


BUILDING PROTEOMATIC
--------------------

Proteomatic requires Qt, and building is straightforward:

$ git submodule update --init
$ qmake "PROTEOMATIC_PORTABLE=1"
$ make release

This gives you a version which will run from within the source directory, 
downloads all scripts and required software packages into its own directory
and does not change anything else in the file tree.
